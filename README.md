## Dataset Summary

This dataset contains approximately 30,000 translation pairs between **Italian and Latin**, 1 train split.

The Latin text is sourced from the `grosenthal/latin_english_parallel` dataset, which itself was collected roughly 66% from the Loeb Classical Library and 34% from the Vulgate translation.

The Italian text in this dataset was generated by **translating the modernized English** from the `grosenthal/latin_english_parallel` dataset.

## Dataset Creation

### Latin Source
The Latin portion of this dataset originates from `grosenthal/latin_english_parallel`. As detailed in the original dataset card:
*   Approximately 66% of the Latin texts are from the Loeb Classical Library.
*   Approximately 34% are from the Vulgate translation.
*   For texts from the Loeb Classical Library, alignment was performed manually between the original Source (Latin) and Target (English) sequences. The original Latin is not copyrighted.

### English Modernization (Context for Italian Translation)
The English translations in the `grosenthal/latin_english_parallel` dataset were originally copyrighted and outdated. To address this, they were modernized and transformed into public domain versions using `gpt-3.5-turbo` with the following prompt:
```
Translate an old dataset from the 1800s to modern English while preserving the original meaning and exact same sentence structure. Retain extended adjectives, dependent clauses, and punctuation. Output the translation preceded by the text "Modern Translation: ". If a given translation is not a complete sentence, repeat the input sentence.
```
Outputs were then manually corrected.

### Italian Translation
The Italian texts in *this* dataset (`italian_latin_parallel`) were created by translating the **modernized English** (described above) from the `grosenthal/latin_english_parallel` dataset into Italian.

*   **Method:** Machine translation using [Google Translate]

## Data Fields

Each sample is annotated with:
*   `id`: A unique identifier for the sample.
*   `translation`: A dictionary containing the language pair:
    *   `it`: The Italian text.
    *   `la`: The Latin text.
*   `index`: The original index from the source data.
*   `file`: The original file (and therefore author/work) that the Latin sample is from.

Example:
```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "translation": {
    "it": "IN principio Dio creò il cielo e la terra.",
    "la": "IN PRINCIPIO creavit Deus caelum et terram."
  },
  "index": 0,
  "file": "vulgate/gen.txt"
}
```

## Data Splits

*   **train**: 100% (approximately 30,000 pairs)

## Intended Uses & Limitations

This dataset can be used for:
*   Training machine translation models for Italian-Latin or Latin-Italian.
*   Linguistic research on parallel corpora involving classical and modern languages.
*   Cross-lingual information retrieval.

**Limitations:**
*   The Italian translations are based on modernized English versions of historical translations, not directly from the original Latin by the Italian translator. This introduces an intermediary step.
*   The stylistic nuances of the original Latin authors might be somewhat filtered through the English modernization and subsequent Italian translation.

## How to Use with `datasets`

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("[Your Hugging Face Username]/italian_latin_parallel")

print(dataset["train"][0])
# Output:
# {
#   'id': '0',
#   'translation': {'it': 'IN principio Dio creò il cielo e la terra.', 'la': 'IN PRINCIPIO creavit Deus caelum et terram.'},
#   'index': 0,
#   'file': 'vulgate/gen.txt'
# }
```
